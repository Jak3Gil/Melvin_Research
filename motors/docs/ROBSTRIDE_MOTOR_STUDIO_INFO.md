# Robstride Motor Studio - Download and Language Information

## GitHub Repository

**Official Repository**: https://github.com/RobStride/MotorStudio

## Current Status

Based on the GitHub repository:
- The repository appears to contain **documentation/manuals** (使用说明书 - User Manual in Chinese)
- The repository may not include the executable software directly
- Documentation appears to be in Chinese

## Language Support

According to search results:
- The software interface may not be in English by default
- Documentation/manuals appear to be in Chinese
- The repository has a folder named "使用说明书-Instructions" (User Manual-Instructions)
- You may need to:
  1. Check language settings within the application
  2. Use translation tools for documentation
  3. Contact RobStride support for English version

## Alternative Approaches

Since Motor Studio may not work or be available in English, consider:

### Option 1: Configure Motors Using Python Scripts

Since you're already using Python scripts with L91 protocol, you might be able to:
- Create configuration scripts based on L91 protocol documentation
- Configure motors programmatically
- Use CAN ID configuration commands (if documented)

### Option 2: Hardware Configuration

Check your motors for:
- DIP switches for CAN ID selection
- Jumpers for ID configuration
- Hardware configuration methods

### Option 3: Contact RobStride Support

- Contact RobStride support for:
  - English version of Motor Studio
  - Configuration documentation
  - Alternative configuration methods

### Option 4: Use Alternative CAN Configuration Tools

If Motor Studio doesn't work, you could try:
- Generic CAN bus configuration tools
- CAN bus analyzers with configuration capabilities
- Create custom configuration scripts based on L91 protocol

## Next Steps

1. **Check the GitHub repository** for releases or downloads
2. **Look for language settings** in the software (if you have it installed)
3. **Try hardware configuration** (DIP switches/jumpers) if available
4. **Create Python configuration script** based on L91 protocol documentation
5. **Contact RobStride support** for English documentation/software

## Note

Since you're already successfully communicating with 2 motors using Python scripts and L91 protocol, you might not need Motor Studio if you can:
- Find the CAN ID configuration command format
- Create a Python script to configure motors
- Use hardware configuration methods

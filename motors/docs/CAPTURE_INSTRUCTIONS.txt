AVAILABLE COM PORTS:

  3. COM7 - LOCKED (probably Motor Studio)
  4. COM4 - AVAILABLE

RECOMMENDED PORT: COM5

AUTOMATED CAPTURE INSTRUCTIONS:
================================

Since Windows locks COM ports, you need to use serial port monitor software.

STEP 1: Download Serial Port Monitor
  URL: https://free-serial-port-monitor.com/
  (Free trial available)

STEP 2: Install and Run Serial Port Monitor
  - Install the software
  - Launch it

STEP 3: Start Monitoring
  - Port: COM5
  - Baud: 921600
  - Data bits: 8
  - Stop bits: 1
  - Parity: None

STEP 4: Open Motor Studio
  - Launch motor_tool.exe
  - Connect to the same port
  - Motor Studio and monitor can both use the port!

STEP 5: Perform Actions
  - Scan for motors
  - Enable a motor
  - Move a motor
  - Each action generates commands

STEP 6: Export Captured Data
  - Select all captured commands
  - Export as CSV format
  - Save as: motor_studio_capture.csv

STEP 7: Analyze Commands
  Run: python analyze_captured_commands.py motor_studio_capture.csv

ALTERNATIVE: Direct Capture (if Motor Studio is NOT running)
  Run: python capture_motor_studio_commands.py
  (Will only work if port is not locked)

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. If Motor Studio is running:
   - Use Serial Port Monitor (see above)
   - This is the only reliable method

2. If Motor Studio is NOT running:
   - Port should be available
   - But Motor Studio needs to be running to send commands!
   - So this doesn't help much...

3. Best Solution:
   - Use Serial Port Monitor software
   - It works alongside Motor Studio
   - No port locking issues
